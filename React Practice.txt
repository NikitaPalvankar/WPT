Check if two Strings are Anagrams of each other


Given two non-empty strings s1 and s2 of lowercase letters, determine if they are anagrams — i.e., if they contain the same characters with the same frequencies.

Examples:

Input: s1 = “IET”  s2 = “TEI”
Output: true
Explanation: Both the string have same characters with same frequency. So, they are anagrams.

Input: s1 = "allergy", s2 = "allergyy"
Output: false
Explanation: Although the characters are mostly the same, s2 contains an extra 'y' character. Since the frequency of characters differs, the strings are not anagrams.

Input: s1 = "listen", s2 = "lists"
Output: false
Explanation: The characters in the two strings are not the same — some are missing or extra. So, they are not anagrams.
